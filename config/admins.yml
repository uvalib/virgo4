# config/admins.yml
#
# The admins.yml file may or may not be present in the /config directory when
# Virgo is running. If this file is not present, no admin privileges are given
# to any user, logged in or not logged in.
#
# When this file is present, those users whose computing IDs are listed in this
# file have those privileges granted for the privilege group under which they
# are listed.
#
# Under a privilege group, each user is listed by <computing ID>: <name>
#
# The <name> may be left blank; it is simply for documentation of the full name
# of the person with that computing ID.
